## Basic C++ library for matrix operations  

This tin library contains a simple implementation of basic matrix operations, including the Compressed Sparse Row  (CSR) approach for efficient operations on sparse matrices. I wrote this library as a tiny refresher on matrices and as a preparation for my bachelors thesis. 

### Features

- fully templated code
- matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication implemented via operator overloading
- transpose, inverse and determinant calculation
- multiple ways to initialize a matrix object (arbitary STL container implementing iterators)
- CSR matrix representation
- efficient matrix multiplication for CSR matrices
- basic matrix decomposition (LU, QR, Cholesky)
- basic matrix factorization (SVD, Eigenvalue decomposition)
- basic matrix solvers (Gauss, Jacobi, Seidel, SOR)
